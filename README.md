## Basic Information
The application is hosted on Redner. You can see it [here](https://weatherapp-97de.onrender.com)

## Functionality
App allows for checking for weather information in places around the world. The main point of this appplication was to check the usage of some APIs with free model.
The weather information is sourced from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org) The app uses Geolocation API to find user's location. For the places autocomplete in the
input ment to search a location by typing one im using [Geoapify](https://www.geoapify.com). To display selected location's forecast i also use the reverse geocoding from
[OpenCageData](https://opencagedata.com). The OpenCageData could be ommited in favor of doing it with already present geoapify api but due to the fact that i'm using free plans
its better to diversify in order to increase the ammount of free calls that can be made.
